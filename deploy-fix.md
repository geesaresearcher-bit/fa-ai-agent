# Fix for React Router "Not Found" Issue

## Problem
When you navigate to `/chat` directly in your deployed React app, you get "Not Found" because the server doesn't know how to handle client-side routes.

## Solution Applied

I've created several fixes:

### 1. Added `_redirects` file
- Created `client/public/_redirects` with `/*    /index.html   200`
- This tells the server to serve `index.html` for all routes

### 2. Added post-build script
- Updated `client/package.json` to copy `_redirects` to build folder
- This ensures the redirect file is included in the build

### 3. Updated render.yaml
- Added route rewriting to handle SPA routing
- Added security headers

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix React Router SPA routing for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Render:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Find your frontend service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" or it will auto-deploy from GitHub

3. **Test the fix:**
   - Visit your frontend URL
   - Navigate to `/chat` directly
   - It should now work!

## Alternative Manual Fix (if needed)

If the above doesn't work, you can also:

1. **In Render dashboard:**
   - Go to your frontend service
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Add a "Redirect" rule:
     - **Source**: `/*`
     - **Destination**: `/index.html`
     - **Status**: `200`

This will ensure all routes serve your React app, and React Router will handle the client-side routing.
