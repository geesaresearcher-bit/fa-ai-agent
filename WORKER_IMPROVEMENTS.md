# üîß Worker Improvements - Hubspot Connection Check

## ‚úÖ **What I Added:**

### **1. Hubspot Connection Check**
- Worker now checks if Hubspot is connected before processing emails
- Prevents 401 errors by skipping processing when Hubspot is not connected
- Logs when skipping due to missing Hubspot connection

### **2. Better Error Handling**
- Added error handling for calendar events processing
- Added error handling for Hubspot contacts processing
- Failed items are marked as processed to avoid retrying

### **3. Improved Logging**
- Clear messages when skipping due to missing connections
- Better error reporting for failed processing
- Prevents infinite retry loops

## üîç **How It Works Now:**

### **Before Processing Emails:**
```javascript
// Check if Hubspot is connected before processing emails
if (!user.hubspot_tokens || !user.hubspot_tokens.access_token) {
    console.log(`[proactive] Skipping email processing for user ${user._id} - Hubspot not connected`);
    return;
}
```

### **Error Handling:**
```javascript
if (result.ok && result.isUnknownSender) {
    // Success - process unknown sender
} else if (result.ok && !result.isUnknownSender) {
    // Success - known sender
} else {
    // Error - mark as processed to avoid retrying
    console.log(`[proactive] Error processing email: ${result.error}`);
    await db.collection('emails').updateOne(
        { _id: email._id },
        { $set: { processed_for_proactive: true } }
    );
}
```

## üìä **Expected Logs:**

### **‚úÖ When Hubspot is Connected:**
```
[proactive] Processing emails for user: 68da0805c67f522fa24c1486
[proactive] Found 5 recent emails to process
[proactive] Processing email from: test@example.com, subject: Test Email
[proactive] Result: { ok: true, isUnknownSender: true, contactCreated: true, welcomeEmailSent: true }
[proactive] Unknown sender detected: test@example.com
[proactive] Email marked as processed: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è When Hubspot is Not Connected:**
```
[proactive] Skipping email processing for user 68da0805c67f522fa24c1486 - Hubspot not connected
```

### **‚ùå When Processing Fails:**
```
[proactive] Processing email from: test@example.com, subject: Test Email
[proactive] Result: { ok: false, error: 'Request failed with status code 401' }
[proactive] Error processing email: Request failed with status code 401
```

## üß™ **Testing the Improvements:**

### **Test 1: Hubspot Not Connected**
1. **Disconnect Hubspot** in frontend
2. **Wait 2 minutes** for worker to run
3. **Check logs** for: `Skipping email processing - Hubspot not connected`

### **Test 2: Hubspot Connected**
1. **Connect Hubspot** in frontend
2. **Send test email** from unknown address
3. **Wait 2 minutes** for worker to process
4. **Check logs** for successful processing

### **Test 3: Error Handling**
1. **Send test email** from unknown address
2. **Check logs** for error handling
3. **Verify** email is marked as processed even if failed

## üöÄ **Benefits:**

### **1. Prevents 401 Errors**
- No more 401 errors when Hubspot is not connected
- Worker skips processing instead of failing

### **2. Better Performance**
- No unnecessary API calls when Hubspot is not connected
- Prevents infinite retry loops

### **3. Clear Logging**
- Easy to see when Hubspot is not connected
- Clear error messages for debugging

### **4. Robust Error Handling**
- Failed items are marked as processed
- No infinite retry loops
- Better error reporting

## üîß **How to Test:**

### **Step 1: Test Without Hubspot**
1. **Disconnect Hubspot** in frontend
2. **Wait 2 minutes** for worker to run
3. **Check logs** for skipping message

### **Step 2: Test With Hubspot**
1. **Connect Hubspot** in frontend
2. **Send test email** from unknown address
3. **Wait 2 minutes** for processing
4. **Check logs** for successful processing

### **Step 3: Test Error Handling**
1. **Send test email** from unknown address
2. **Check logs** for error handling
3. **Verify** email is marked as processed

## üìù **Expected Behavior:**

### **‚úÖ Working Correctly:**
- No 401 errors when Hubspot is not connected
- Clear logging when skipping processing
- Successful processing when Hubspot is connected
- Failed items are marked as processed

### **‚ùå Still Not Working:**
- 401 errors persist (Hubspot connection issue)
- No logging when skipping
- Infinite retry loops
- Failed items not marked as processed

## üéØ **Success Criteria:**

The worker is working correctly when:
1. ‚úÖ No 401 errors when Hubspot is not connected
2. ‚úÖ Clear logging when skipping processing
3. ‚úÖ Successful processing when Hubspot is connected
4. ‚úÖ Failed items are marked as processed
5. ‚úÖ No infinite retry loops

The improvements I made should prevent the 401 errors and make the worker more robust!
